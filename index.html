            <p>Rongbin is a bioinformatics postdoc specializing in gene regulation and cell-cell communication in Dr. Kaifu Chen's lab at Boston Children's Hospital. He is co-mentored by Dr. Yu-Hua Tseng from the Joslin Diabetes Center. Rongbin completed his Ph.D. research in Dr. Shirley Liu's lab at Tongji University and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. During his Ph.D., he developed the Cistrome Data Browser and Toolkit for human and mouse genomic data analysis using a compendium of ChIP-seq and chromatin accessibility data. This web tool has received over 400,000 visits and has been cited in over 900 publications. Currently, Rongbin is working on computational models for intercellular communications using single-cell sequencing data. He recently introduced MEBOCOST, the first sophisticated algorithm for analyzing single-cell metabolite cell communication. Additionally, Rongbin is interested in the epigenetic regulation of thermogenesis in adipose tissue, given its potential for intervention in various metabolic diseases, including obesity and diabetes. Outside of work, Rongbin enjoys cooking and spending quality time with his family.</p>
